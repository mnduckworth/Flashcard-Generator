# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator is a node.js console based application that uses the inquirer npm package to ask for various types of user input.

The application will allow you to create two different types of flashcards, a basic card or a cloze card.

The basic card is a standard question on the front and anser on the back type of card, while a cloze card is a statement with part of it hidden or taken out.

The card data is then pushed into an array where you can go back and look at the cards you created.

This application does not use persistent storage so each time you reset the application the cards you created in the past will be gone.
